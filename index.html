      <p>In this document, we will outline our high level test plan for the get-a-room Online Hotel Booking System.

        <div class="w3-center"><p><b>Table 1.</b> System requirements described by the get-a-room team.</p></div>
      <p>
        The objective of our testing will be to evaluate the design’s functional, performance, and internal design characteristics. The requirement identifiers labeled in Table 1 will help to describe the testing plan as it encompasses each characteristic of the system. This process is further described in the section that follows. 
      </p>
  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Functional Characteristics</h2>
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Requirements tested: FR-1 - FR-14</h3>
  <p>Our test plan will need to evaluate whether or not the system is able to complete all tasks laid out in Table 1. Functionally, it will also need to be assessed to ensure all modules are able to integrate with one another. It will also need to be tested for correctness through validation testing. Due to the relative simplicity of the application, our test process will cover all of the Functional Requirements stated by the development team. The intricate details of the machine learning algorithm that produces suggestions based upon user interaction will be outside of the test scope. However, our test plan will cover the validity of the products of this algorithm.</p>
  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Internal Design Characteristics</h2>
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Requirements tested: NFR-1 - NFR-4</h3>
  <p>Non-Functional requirements 1-4 cover the internal design of the application. We intend to test these by giving a pass or fail rating based on the ability of the design to accomplish these tasks. NFR-1 and NFR-4 will be satisfied if the design does fulfill these requirements. We will consider NFR-2 and NFR-3 complete if the application can interface with 3 hotel and banking institutions respectively</p>
  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Performance Characteristics</h2>
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Requirements tested: NFR-5 - NFR-7</h3>
  <p>The performance requirements specified by the developers cover the scalability, integrity, and availability of the application. Our test scope will cover the investigation of how these requirements are satisfied. Since a database storage solution is used on the server side, NFR-5 will be satisfied simply based on the solution chosen. NFR-6 will be assessed as a part of validation testing, and NFR-7 will be tested by simulating a heavy transaction load and monitoring the system’s response.</p>


  <!-- Part 2 Test Plan-->
  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Part 2: Test Plan - Integration Testing</h2>
  <p>To integrate the three modules (client side, server side, and orchestrator), the best way is through three phases of continuous integration. Continuous integration allows for developers to integrate code into the repository frequently. Each integration is also automatically built and automatically tested.</p>
  <p>Each phase consists of coding, automated testing, reporting, and source control. Each of these phases will be tested in isolation. This is to test the basic functionality of each module, detect early and easy to track bugs, and eliminate the possibility of errors being caused by another module’s code. After code is committed into the repository, it will be automatically tested. Reports will determine if integrated code has passed the units tests. If not, integrated code will be source controlled and will restart the at the beginning of the phase of coding. If tests are passed, that phase will be completed and the module will be deployed.</p>
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Phase 1: Client Side Testing</h3>
  <p>Phase one contains the client side portion of the system. This includes the user interface, system management, and core functionality of the web application. The user interface is the only way the end users will interact with the get a room web application. Testing must be done so that all features on the front end are correctly displaying and properly functioning. The system management needs to be tested on how well the user interface can handle authentication of users and guests. This portion of the testing will be cursory in this section as we are simply trying to verify that the system works as a whole, but more thoroughly examined during validation testing. Core functionality such as itinerary management and confirmation allows for a meaningful user experience.We believe that testing the client side system in Phase one will allow us to gain insight into features users like and don’t like earlier in the build process which will prevent us from having us to double back and retest portions of the code late in the integration assessment process.</p>
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Phase 2: Server Side Testing</h3>
  <p>Phase two focuses on the server side portion of the application, the database. Since the database will hold a large collection of data, testing must be thorough and intensive to assure the correctness of information. We will also handle testing the scalability of the database in this portion. As the creators do not wish to have any physical servers and instead rely on the Cloud for server side processing, we do not need to perform any testing on the server side system beyond this verification.</p>
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Phase 3: Orchestrator Testing</h3>
  <p>The final phase is bringing in the system that connects the client and server, the orchestrator. Correct configuration will be necessary to ensure the interoperability of the modules. To ensure this, payment and reservation processing will be part of the final phase. Payment processing will be tested by making HTTP requests to financial company APIs and handling the HTTP responses. Testing is to make sure the web application is able to generate revenue and profit. This also applies to hotel HTTP web service requests so the orchestrator has the most up to date hotel information.</p>

  <!-- Part 4 Validation-->
  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Part 4: Test Plan - Validation Testing</h2>
  <p>As part of the validation process, we will conduct tests to ensure proper functionality and expected behavior of the web application. The tests will be separated into 6 categories, each testing a separate functionality.</p>
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Usability Testing</h3>
  <p>Usability testing is a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users. This can be seen as an irreplaceable usability practice, since it gives direct input on how real users use the system. This will ensure that the mobile app and website are easy to use and provide a satisfactory user experience to the customers. It will also provide information towards if users are able to complete discrete tasks successfully and identify how long it takes to complete each task.</p>
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Compatibility Testing</h3>
  <p>Compatibility testing is a part of non-functional testing conducted on application software to ensure the application's compatibility with different computing environments.This will check whether the system is capable of running on different hardware, operating systems, applications, network environments or mobile devices according to the requirements.</p>  
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Interface Testing</h3>
  <p>An interface is a connection that integrates two components within a system. An interface can range from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to APIs and server based communication between the database server to application server or client to web server. Interface Testing is defined as a software testing type which verifies whether the communication between two different software systems is done correctly.</p>  
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Services Testing</h3>
  <p>Web Services Testing is a type of software testing that validates the mechanism of communication through which two applications / devices exchange data. The purpose of Web Services Testing is to check the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of an API(Application Program Interface). Testing the services of the application will occur both online and offline and should be irrespective of underlying architecture.</p> 
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Performance Testing</h3>
  <p>Performance testing is a testing practice performed to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. In the context of a web application, we will be testing and analyzing the metrics below:</p>
