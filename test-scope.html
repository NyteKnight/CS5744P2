      <p>In this document, we will outline our high level test plan for the get-a-room Online Hotel Booking System. This system is designed to allow users to locate available hotel rooms in a desired area and manage the entirety of the booking process. Our test plan will seek to ensure the functionality of this system from an integration and validation perspective.
      </p>
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Part 1: Test Scope</h1>
      <p>To properly test this plan, we will need to approach the system from the requirements described by the team for their final product. The requirements are shown below in Table 1 below, which was provided by the get-a-room team.</p>

        <div class="w3-center"><p><b>Table 1.</b> System requirements described by the get-a-room team.</p></div>
      <p>
        The objective of our testing will be to evaluate the design’s functional, performance, and internal design characteristics. The requirement identifiers labeled in Table 1 will help to describe the testing plan as it encompasses each characteristic of the system. This process is further described in the section that follows. 
      </p>
  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Functional Characteristics</h2>
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Requirements tested: FR-1 - FR-14</h3>
  <p>Our test plan will need to evaluate whether or not the system is able to complete all tasks laid out in Table 1. Functionally, it will also need to be assessed to ensure all modules are able to integrate with one another. It will also need to be tested for correctness through validation testing. Due to the relative simplicity of the application, our test process will cover all of the Functional Requirements stated by the development team. The intricate details of the machine learning algorithm that produces suggestions based upon user interaction will be outside of the test scope. However, our test plan will cover the validity of the products of this algorithm.</p>
  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Internal Design Characteristics</h2>
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Requirements tested: NFR-1 - NFR-4</h3>
  <p>Non-Functional requirements 1-4 cover the internal design of the application. We intend to test these by giving a pass or fail rating based on the ability of the design to accomplish these tasks. NFR-1 and NFR-4 will be satisfied if the design does fulfill these requirements. We will consider NFR-2 and NFR-3 complete if the application can interface with 3 hotel and banking institutions respectively</p>
  <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Performance Characteristics</h2>
  <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Requirements tested: NFR-5 - NFR-7</h3>
  <p>The performance requirements specified by the developers cover the scalability, integrity, and availability of the application. Our test scope will cover the investigation of how these requirements are satisfied. Since a database storage solution is used on the server side, NFR-5 will be satisfied simply based on the solution chosen. NFR-6 will be assessed as a part of validation testing, and NFR-7 will be tested by simulating a heavy transaction load and monitoring the system’s response.</p>
